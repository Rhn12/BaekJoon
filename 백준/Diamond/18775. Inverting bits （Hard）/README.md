### 문제 설명

<p>The wannabe scientist Kleofáš has recently developed a new processor. The processor has got 26 registers, labeled <code>A</code> to <code>Z</code>. Each register is an 8-bit unsigned integer variable.</p>

<p>This new processor is incredibly simple. It only supports the instructions specified in the table below. (In all instructions, <code>R</code> is a name of a register, <code>C</code> is a constant, and <code>X</code> is either the name of a register or a constant. All constants are 8-bit unsigned integers, i.e., numbers from 0 to 255.)</p>

</table>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>After any instruction other than not, if the second argument was a register name, its content remains unchanged.</li>
	<li>Whenever <code>shl</code> or <code>shr</code> is called, the shifted value of the first argument is truncated on one end and padded with zeroes on the other end. For example, if <code>X</code> equals to binary 10110110, then <code>X shr 2</code> equals to 00101101.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example task</strong></p>

<p>Assume that the input contains an arbitrary two 8-bit unsigned integers a and b. Write a program that will read these numbers and produce an integer z such that z = 0 if and only if a = b. (That is, if a and b differ, z must be positive.)</p>

<p><strong>Problem specification</strong></p>

<p>For each data set, you have to write a program for Kleofáš’s processor that solves the following task: The input for your program is a sequence of integers, each of them a 0 or a 1. The output of your program must be a sequence of their negations, in order. (That is, change each 0 into a 1 and vice versa.)</p>

<p>The sequence contains exactly 19 integers. In your program, you may only use the instruction <code>not</code> at most twice. Your program can have at most 300 instructions.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>This problem has no input.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Send us your program as a plain ASCII text. Each line of the text may either contain one complete instruction, or just whitespace. If you submit anything that is not a proper program, it will be judged “Wrong answer” and you will get an appropriate error message.</p>
